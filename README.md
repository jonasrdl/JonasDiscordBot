### I am giving you permission to use the code for your own project. If you do, please mention me somehow.

## General Setup

If you want to use your own token, create a file called "config.json" in the `src` folder and enter the token like this:   

Example:
```json
{
  "token": "your-discord-bot-token"
}
```
## Informations

<b>Don't give your bot token to anyone, they have access to your entire bot. If you publish your code, do it as described above and add the config folder to the .gitignore.</b> 

If you can help me with problems ([Issues](https://github.com/jonasrdl/JonasDiscordBot/issues)), please do a merge request.

There are still many bugs that cause the bot to crash with certain commands, if all these bugs are fixed I will probably make it public.
