# JonasDiscordBot
## I am giving you permission to use the code for your own project. If you do please mention me somehow. 

This is my first Discord bot, nothing special.

If you want to use your own token, create a file called "config.json" and enter the token like this: {"token": "your token"}. 
The API Key for Openweathermap is also in this file as {"api_token": "your API token"}.

Any questions? feel free to contact me here:
