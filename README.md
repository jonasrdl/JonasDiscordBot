### I am giving you permission to use the code for your own project. If you do please mention me somehow.

If you want to use your own token, create a file called "config.json" and enter the token like this: {"token": "your token"}.
The API Key for Openweathermap is also in this file as {"api_token": "your API token"} - (Logically both in the same object).

Example:
```json
{
  "token": "your-discord-bot-token",
  "api_token": "your-api-token"
}
```

If you can help me with problems ([Issues](https://github.com/jonasrdl/JonasDiscordBot/issues)), please do a merge request

There are still many bugs that cause the bot to crash with certain commands, if all these bugs are fixed I will probably make it public.
